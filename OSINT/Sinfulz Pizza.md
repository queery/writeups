Go back to the website:

There is a menu button for the [database](https://yummycrustypizza.com/database.html)

**Database page...**
```
Dear customers, we were hacked and this sensitive page has been removed from our publicly facing website. We do fear that the page was indexed though. Hopefully no one can OSINT the old page. In the meantime, Google has been contacted to remove any form of indexing from their search engine.
Sorry for any inconvenience caused.

Ah! a pastebin link
[pastebin link](https://pastebin.com/BvatWyq8)

## Pastbin
It contains a recipe but also a link:
`Unlock our secret recipe at: https://cryptobin.co/j5h5l4y8`

## Cyptobin
As expected there is an encrypted message that requires a password...

Those paswords look like hex but [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=From_Hex('Auto')&input=ZGIwZWRkMDRhYWFjNDUwNmY3ZWRhYjAzYWM4NTVkNTY) does not agree.
